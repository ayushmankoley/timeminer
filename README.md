# 🚀 Project Title

# TimeMiner - Mine The Blockchain ⛏️

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
 
**Problem Statement 2 – Unleash blockchain gameplay with Monad**

---

## 🎯 Objective

What problem does your project solve, and who does it serve?

- Answer: TimeMiner makes blockchain easy and fun by turning it into a simple mining game. It helps users learn Web3 basics and boosts activity on the Monad Testnet.

Real-world use case and value:

- Answer: Players use MON tokens to buy miners, earn $ORE over time, and upgrade. It drives real on-chain activity while teaching blockchain concepts through gameplay.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`SleepyDev`

### Team Members:  
- Ayushman Koley

### Your Approach:  
- I wanted to create a fun, accessible way for users to interact with blockchain by simply staying active and upgrading miners — making Web3 feel rewarding without complexity.  
- Key challenges were designing a fair mining system, handling global halving mechanics, and keeping gameplay fast and cheap on-chain using Monad's speed.  
- After brainstorming, I shifted towards a simple idle mining model that mirrors real-world crypto mining but stays lightweight, playful, and easy for everyone to join.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core Technologies Used:
- Frontend: Next.js, DaisyUI, TailwindCSS, Scaffold-ETH 2
- Backend: Solidity Smart Contracts (for game logic and $ORE mining)
- Database: No traditional database — all state is stored on-chain
- APIs: Ethers.js, Wagmi + Viem, Groq API (for chatbot functionality)
- Hosting: Vercel (Frontend) + Monad Testnet (Blockchain backend)

### Sponsor Technologies Used (if any):
- [✅] **Groq:** Used Groq API to power the in-game chatbot, providing players with instant, AI-driven assistance and gameplay tips.
- [✅] **Monad:** Deployed smart contracts on the Monad Testnet; used MON as the transaction currency for mining, upgrading, and claiming $ORE tokens.  
- [ ] **Fluvio:** _Real-time data handling_  
- [ ] **Base:** _AgentKit / OnchainKit / Smart Wallet usage_  
- [ ] **Screenpipe:** _Screen-based analytics or workflows_  
- [ ] **Stellar:** _Payments, identity, or token usage_
