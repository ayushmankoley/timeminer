TimeMiner Game Logic:
Time Miner is a blockchain-powered idle mining game deployed on the MONAD testnet blockchain where players earn $ORE tokens over time through their virtual miners. Players buy miners with MON. Each miner has a power level that determines the mining speed. Players can upgrade their miners to increase mining power. $ORE tokens are mined automatically over time, and players can claim their mined $ORE at any time through an on-chain claim. Mining power is based on the total power level across all miners owned by a player. Higher power results in faster $ORE earning. There is a global cap on how much $ORE can be mined per second across all players. This cap halves at defined milestones, similar to Bitcoin's halving mechanism. As more $ORE is mined globally, the maximum mining rate reduces in stages: less than 468,750 ORE mined allows 100 ORE per second, less than 937,500 ORE mined allows 50 ORE per second, less than 1,875,000 ORE mined allows 25 ORE per second, less than 3,750,000 ORE mined allows 12 ORE per second, less than 7,500,000 ORE mined allows 6 ORE per second, less than 15,000,000 ORE mined allows 3 ORE per second, and less than 22,500,000 ORE mined allows 2 ORE per second. The total supply of $ORE tokens is 30,000,000. Mining becomes slower globally over time, making early miners more profitable. The game features different miner types with specific upgrade paths. Miner Alpha has the following upgrade costs and power levels: Level 1 costs 0.1 MON for 1 power, Level 2 costs 0.025 MON for 2 power, Level 3 costs 0.05 MON for 3 power, Level 4 costs 0.1 MON for 4 power, and Level 5 costs 0.2 MON for 5 power. Miner Beta has the following upgrade costs and power levels: Level 1 costs 0.4 MON for 1 power, Level 2 costs 0.15 MON for 2 power, Level 3 costs 0.25 MON for 3 power, Level 4 costs 0.5 MON for 4 power, and Level 5 costs 0.7 MON for 5 power. Miner Gamma has the following upgrade costs and power levels: Level 1 costs 1.0 MON for 2 power, Level 2 costs 0.5 MON for 4 power, Level 3 costs 1.0 MON for 6 power, Level 4 costs 1.25 MON for 8 power, and Level 5 costs 1.25 MON for 10 power. The total token supply is 30 million $ORE. The claim mechanism is on-chain. Mining power is based on miner levels. A global halving occurs as the total mined $ORE increases. Early players will enjoy higher mining speeds before halving events make $ORE rarer and more valuable. Players are encouraged to upgrade wisely to maximize their earnings and dominate the Time Miner leaderboard.
